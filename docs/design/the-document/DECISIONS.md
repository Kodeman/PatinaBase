## Locked decisions (seeded from spec §2, v1.0 April 2026)

| ID | Decision |
|----|----------|
| D1 | Strict one document at a time. No split view, no peek/hold. Esc or "Put down" is the only exit; switching costs one trip through the Desk or a ⌘K jump. |
| D2 | Interruptions are designer-driven, never system-dictated. Nothing breaks through by default; per-designer break-through rules, shipping with zero enabled. |
| D3 | Mobile pattern: margin items collapse to anchored chips; spine becomes a bottom sheet. Dedicated mobile milestone gates the default flip (D7). |
| D4 | No shadows. Anywhere. No exceptions. Value contrast + flat stacked edges + folder tab; mechanically enforced via lint, CI-blocking. |
| D5 | The Weekly Pulse lives in the margin (kind `pulse`, anchored to the Project section). Friday unsent Pulses rise on the Desk. |
| D6 | Documents visible to all studio members; no exclusive holds. Soft presence line in the spine; per-member "needs *your* hand". |
| D7 | Ship alongside, phase in. Parallel flagged route against real data; zones dissolve only after validation + mobile pattern. |
| D8 | Studio Drawer persistent on every screen; ledgers open as overlay sheets; collapsed by default, no badges, no pulsing counts. |
| D9 | Time: capture in the document (spine timer), review in the drawer (Hours ledger). |
| D10 | Suggestive, adjustable capture. Timer counts, designer adjusts up or down, nothing auto-trims. <60s discards silently. Idle detection only annotates. |
| D11 | Timer auto-starts on pick up — provisional, pending Leah's gut-check; fall back to one-tap start if it feels surveilling. |

## Open — needs design ruling

### O1 · Document identity vs codebase lifecycle split — 2026-06-11

**Conflict:** Spec §1 says one document per *client relationship*; spec §3 routes `/doc/[projectId]`. Codebase: the lifecycle is split across `designer_clients` (lead→proposal→active→completed→nurture), `proposals` (own status chain, version supersede), and `projects` — and a project row **only exists after signing** (`activate_proposal_as_project`). A client may have several projects; projects can also be created manually with no proposal lineage.
**Proposed resolution (CODEBASE-MAP §4):** document = project when one exists; pre-signing, document = live proposal chain (or lead). Desk unions the three shapes. A client with two projects shows two folders. Manual projects render Brief→Proposal as ghost sections. Also: no "direction shared" marker exists — Direction is proposed as "latest proposal in draft".
**Blocks:** Slice 1.

### O2 · Stamp vocabulary divergence — 2026-06-11

**Conflict:** Spec §6 stamps `to_order → ordered → in_production → shipped → received → installed` (+ `decision_due/extended`, `damaged/returned`). Codebase FF&E machine (00184, DB-enforced ratchet): `specified → quoted → approved → ordered → production → shipped → delivered → installed`, plus `blocked`/`blocked_by_decision_id`, inspection outcomes (clean/damaged/partial), damage-claim states. Specifics: `to_order` collapses three designer-meaningful pre-order states; spec `received` = codebase `delivered`; `extended` and `returned` have no data behind them.
**Proposed resolution (CODEBASE-MAP §5):** stamps render the codebase machine 1:1 where it's richer (sub-state as the stamp's second line), `received` derives from `delivered`, drop `extended`/`returned` from v1.
**Blocks:** Slice 1 (need-line stamps), Slice 2.

### O3 · Time system collision — 2026-06-11

**Conflict:** Spec §9 designs a fresh `time_entries` table (seconds, activity vocabulary Design/Sourcing/Client/Site visit/Admin, `raw_seconds`, `idle_seconds`, `source`). The codebase **already shipped** `project_time_entries` (00177) with UI (header TimerButton, stop dialog, ⌘K commands): minutes granularity with **min-1-minute round-up** (spec: sub-60s silent discard), phase/task attribution (no activity vocab), invoice claim/release + guard triggers, one-running-timer-per-user. D11 auto-start also inverts the current manual-start UX.
**Proposed resolution:** extend `project_time_entries` additively (new columns per spec needs); never fork a second table. Needs rulings on: seconds vs minutes; discard vs round-up; activity vocabulary vs/alongside phase attribution; how the existing header timer coexists with the spine timer during phase-in.
**Blocks:** Slice 5 (and the drawer "In hand today" readout).

### O4 · D4 scope vs D7 — 2026-06-11

**Conflict:** D4 demands a CI-blocking shadow ban "in this app" from PR 1. The app currently has 111 `shadow-*` usages in old zones that D7 forbids touching, and `@patina/design-system` primitives (Dialog/Popover/Command) ship shadows into anything that mounts them.
**Proposed resolution:** PR 1 adds the CI-blocking lint scoped to Document surfaces (`/desk`, `/doc`, document/drawer/ledger components) + `shadow-none` overrides wherever design-system primitives are reused inside those surfaces; widen the ban app-wide at the dissolve step.
**Blocks:** Slice 1 PR.

### O5 · Portal surfaces with no Document-model home — 2026-06-11

**Conflict:** The portal has grown past the five zones the design sessions mapped (spec §3). Unmapped: **Aesthete** (Teaching + Aesthete Engine), Insights, Portfolio, Resources, Team, Reviews, Nurture queue, rooms directory, and the vendor directory (People vs Orders ledger?).
**Proposed resolution:** none yet — these stay untouched through the phase-in (D7), but each needs a destiny (ledger, document section, margin, or deliberate exile) before the default flip.
**Blocks:** Slice 6 / default flip only.

## Implementation decisions (code-level; designers wouldn't notice)

### I1 · Feature flag mechanism — 2026-06-11

PostHog flag `the-document-pilot` via the existing `useFeatureFlag` hook (fail-closed, same as `procurement-workspace-pilot`), with the existing `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAG_OVERRIDES` env override serving as the spec's env override. No per-designer DB flag store exists; if per-designer targeting is needed later, PostHog targeting by email covers it without schema work.

### I2 · Brand token source — 2026-06-11

Document surfaces use the CSS vars in `apps/designer-portal/src/app/globals.css` (`--color-clay` etc. — exact spec hexes), not `@patina/design-system/tokens/colors.ts` (different OKLCH values). Fonts already loaded. "Strata Mark" has no existing asset — it will be a new primitive; final name TBD given the repo brand is Patina.

### I3 · Repo-reality corrections to workstream docs — 2026-06-11

The spec/CLAUDE.md reference a "strata monorepo", `@strata/*` packages, and React 18. Reality: patina-merged, `@patina/*`, React 19, Next.js 15. The workstream CLAUDE.md was placed at `apps/designer-portal/CLAUDE.md` with a dated correction note. Also: only prototype v0.3 (`patina-the-document-prototype-v3.html`) exists in `docs/design/the-document/` (no `prototypes/` subdir, no v0.1/v0.2, no concept deck) — references resolved to the file that exists.
