## Locked decisions (seeded from spec §2, v1.0 April 2026)

| ID | Decision |
|----|----------|
| D1 | Strict one document at a time. No split view, no peek/hold. Esc or "Put down" is the only exit; switching costs one trip through the Desk or a ⌘K jump. |
| D2 | Interruptions are designer-driven, never system-dictated. Nothing breaks through by default; per-designer break-through rules, shipping with zero enabled. |
| D3 | Mobile pattern: margin items collapse to anchored chips; spine becomes a bottom sheet. Dedicated mobile milestone gates the default flip (D7). |
| D4 | No shadows. Anywhere. No exceptions. Value contrast + flat stacked edges + folder tab; mechanically enforced via lint, CI-blocking. |
| D5 | The Weekly Pulse lives in the margin (kind `pulse`, anchored to the Project section). Friday unsent Pulses rise on the Desk. |
| D6 | Documents visible to all studio members; no exclusive holds. Soft presence line in the spine; per-member "needs *your* hand". |
| D7 | Ship alongside, phase in. Parallel flagged route against real data; zones dissolve only after validation + mobile pattern. |
| D8 | Studio Drawer persistent on every screen; ledgers open as overlay sheets; collapsed by default, no badges, no pulsing counts. |
| D9 | Time: capture in the document (spine timer), review in the drawer (Hours ledger). |
| D10 | Suggestive, adjustable capture. Timer counts, designer adjusts up or down, nothing auto-trims. <60s discards silently. Idle detection only annotates. |
| D11 | Timer auto-starts on pick up — provisional, pending Leah's gut-check; fall back to one-tap start if it feels surveilling. |

## Open — needs design ruling

### O1 · Document identity vs codebase lifecycle split — 2026-06-11

**Conflict:** Spec §1 says one document per *client relationship*; spec §3 routes `/doc/[projectId]`. Codebase: the lifecycle is split across `designer_clients` (lead→proposal→active→completed→nurture), `proposals` (own status chain, version supersede), and `projects` — and a project row **only exists after signing** (`activate_proposal_as_project`). A client may have several projects; projects can also be created manually with no proposal lineage.
**Proposed resolution (CODEBASE-MAP §4):** document = project when one exists; pre-signing, document = live proposal chain (or lead). Desk unions the three shapes. A client with two projects shows two folders. Manual projects render Brief→Proposal as ghost sections. Also: no "direction shared" marker exists — Direction is proposed as "latest proposal in draft".
**Blocks:** Slice 1.

### O2 · Stamp vocabulary divergence — 2026-06-11

**Conflict:** Spec §6 stamps `to_order → ordered → in_production → shipped → received → installed` (+ `decision_due/extended`, `damaged/returned`). Codebase FF&E machine (00184, DB-enforced ratchet): `specified → quoted → approved → ordered → production → shipped → delivered → installed`, plus `blocked`/`blocked_by_decision_id`, inspection outcomes (clean/damaged/partial), damage-claim states. Specifics: `to_order` collapses three designer-meaningful pre-order states; spec `received` = codebase `delivered`; `extended` and `returned` have no data behind them.
**Proposed resolution (CODEBASE-MAP §5):** stamps render the codebase machine 1:1 where it's richer (sub-state as the stamp's second line), `received` derives from `delivered`, drop `extended`/`returned` from v1.
**Blocks:** Slice 1 (need-line stamps), Slice 2.

### O3 · Time system collision — 2026-06-11

**Conflict:** Spec §9 designs a fresh `time_entries` table (seconds, activity vocabulary Design/Sourcing/Client/Site visit/Admin, `raw_seconds`, `idle_seconds`, `source`). The codebase **already shipped** `project_time_entries` (00177) with UI (header TimerButton, stop dialog, ⌘K commands): minutes granularity with **min-1-minute round-up** (spec: sub-60s silent discard), phase/task attribution (no activity vocab), invoice claim/release + guard triggers, one-running-timer-per-user. D11 auto-start also inverts the current manual-start UX.
**Proposed resolution:** extend `project_time_entries` additively (new columns per spec needs); never fork a second table. Needs rulings on: seconds vs minutes; discard vs round-up; activity vocabulary vs/alongside phase attribution; how the existing header timer coexists with the spine timer during phase-in.
**Blocks:** Slice 5 (and the drawer "In hand today" readout).

### O4 · D4 scope vs D7 — 2026-06-11

**Conflict:** D4 demands a CI-blocking shadow ban "in this app" from PR 1. The app currently has 111 `shadow-*` usages in old zones that D7 forbids touching, and `@patina/design-system` primitives (Dialog/Popover/Command) ship shadows into anything that mounts them.
**Proposed resolution:** PR 1 adds the CI-blocking lint scoped to Document surfaces (`/desk`, `/doc`, document/drawer/ledger components) + `shadow-none` overrides wherever design-system primitives are reused inside those surfaces; widen the ban app-wide at the dissolve step.
**Blocks:** Slice 1 PR.

### O6 · R10–R12 referenced but absent from this log — 2026-06-12

**Gap:** Session 02 prep cited "R10–R15 appended," and R14 references R12's
"needs-action ordering," but only R13–R15 are present in this file — the
R10–R12 text appears to have been truncated in the paste. Blocked on the
missing text: the I6 Desk-heuristics constants retune (R10's calibrated
values exist nowhere in the repo) and dued-note ordering (R12). Slice 4
proceeds on the fully-specified scope (unfolds, Orders ledger, per-item
DAMAGED, R14 Note, R15 fill-state); notes with due dates provisionally rank
with due decisions pending R12.
**Blocks:** I6 retune; final dued-note ordering.

### O5 · Portal surfaces with no Document-model home — 2026-06-11

**Conflict:** The portal has grown past the five zones the design sessions mapped (spec §3). Unmapped: **Aesthete** (Teaching + Aesthete Engine), Insights, Portfolio, Resources, Team, Reviews, Nurture queue, rooms directory, and the vendor directory (People vs Orders ledger?).
**Proposed resolution:** none yet — these stay untouched through the phase-in (D7), but each needs a destiny (ledger, document section, margin, or deliberate exile) before the default flip.
**Blocks:** Slice 6 / default flip only.

---

## Implementation decisions (code-level; designers wouldn't notice)

### I1 · Feature flag mechanism — 2026-06-11

PostHog flag `the-document-pilot` via the existing `useFeatureFlag` hook (fail-closed, same as `procurement-workspace-pilot`), with the existing `NEXT_PUBLIC_FLAG_OVERRIDES` env override serving as the spec's env override. No per-designer DB flag store exists; if per-designer targeting is needed later, PostHog targeting by email covers it without schema work.

### I2 · Brand token source — 2026-06-11

Document surfaces use the CSS vars in `apps/designer-portal/src/app/globals.css` (`--color-clay` etc. — exact spec hexes), not `@patina/design-system/tokens/colors.ts` (different OKLCH values). Fonts already loaded. "Strata Mark" has no existing asset — it will be a new primitive; final name TBD given the repo brand is Patina.

### I3 · Repo-reality corrections to workstream docs — 2026-06-11

The spec/CLAUDE.md reference a "strata monorepo", `@strata/*` packages, and React 18. Reality: patina-merged, `@patina/*`, React 19, Next.js 15. The workstream CLAUDE.md was placed at `apps/designer-portal/CLAUDE.md` with a dated correction note. Also: only prototype v0.3 (`patina-the-document-prototype-v3.html`) exists in `docs/design/the-document/` (no `prototypes/` subdir, no v0.1/v0.2, no concept deck) — references resolved to the file that exists.


## Rulings — design session, 2026-06-11
 
### R1 · Ruling on O1 — Document identity — 2026-06-11
 
A document = one **engagement**: the project once one exists (`/doc/[projectId]`);
pre-signing, the live proposal chain (keyed by chain root); pre-proposal, the
lead/designer_client. The Desk unions all three shapes. A client with N projects
gets N folders (tab = surname, title distinguishes); the client-level view is the
People ledger — the ledger rule applied to relationships. Direction derives from
latest-proposal-in-draft (accepted as approximate; the settled state means
"direction work concluded," not "client reacted" — upgrade the derivation when a
direction-share feature ships). Manual projects ghost Brief→Proposal and open at
Project. Edge cases blessed as audited: `on_hold` = paused in-motion chip, never
"needs your hand"; `archived` = ⌘K/People only; declined/expired proposals hold
at Proposal-active with the state in the need line. Spec §1/§3/§4 updated to
engagement language in v1.1.
 
### R2 · Ruling on O2 — Stamp vocabulary — 2026-06-11
 
Stamps render the codebase FF&E machine 1:1: SPECIFIED / QUOTED / APPROVED /
ORDERED / PRODUCTION / SHIPPED / DELIVERED / INSTALLED, with
`src/components/portal/ffe/stages.ts` STAGE_CONFIG as the canonical label/color
source. RECEIVED is a derived ninth state: `status='delivered'` + clean
receiving inspection logged — "delivered, awaiting inspection" is therefore a
visible studio to-do and a valid need-line input. DAMAGED derives from
inspection outcome / open damage claim, with claim state in the unfold.
DECISION DUE derives from `blocked_by_decision_id` → pending blocking decision
and always displays the *current* due date; extensions are narrated by the
decision margin item, never a stamp. EXTENDED and RETURNED are dropped from v1
(no data). Spec §6 vocabulary superseded.
 
### R3 · Ruling on O4 — Shadow ban scope & defense — 2026-06-11
 
CI-blocking lint scoped to Document directories (/desk, /doc, document/drawer/
ledger component dirs) from the Slice 1 PR; widened app-wide at the dissolve
step. Defense is two ESLint rules (flat config): (1) `no-restricted-syntax`
catching `shadow-*` class strings and `box-shadow`/`drop-shadow` CSS within
Document dirs; (2) `no-restricted-imports` banning direct design-system overlay
primitives (Dialog/Popover/Command/Sheet/Tooltip) in Document dirs — overlays
enter only through Document-local `Doc*` wrappers that bake in `shadow-none`
plus the paper treatment (ink border, flat edges, spec §10 recipes). Wrappers
are portal-local first, promoted per the catalog-ui precedent when the client
portal mirrors need them. Old zones untouched until dissolve (D7 upheld).
 
### R4 · Ruling on O3 — Time system unification — 2026-06-11
 
Extend `project_time_entries` additively; never fork. `duration_minutes`
remains canonical (invoice guard triggers, `project_unbilled_time` view, and
shipped data untouched); add `raw_seconds` (pre-adjustment elapsed, audit
trail), `idle_seconds` (annotation only — never subtracted, per D10), `source`
('timer_auto' | 'timer_manual' | 'manual_entry'), and `activity`. Attribution
is two-dimensional: `phase_key` auto-fills from the document's current phase at
log time (the spine knows where the pen is — the designer is never asked), and
the picker asks only `activity` (Design / Sourcing / Client / Site visit /
Admin in v1); `task_id` stays optional. The sub-60s rule follows start mode:
`timer_auto` discards silently, `timer_manual` keeps the shipped
round-up-to-1-minute. Picking up a document chains out ANY running timer
(header-started included) through the log-offer strip — one mechanic
everywhere. The header TimerButton continues unchanged in old zones through the
phase-in and dissolves with them. Granularity ruled at implementation level
(designer-invisible): minutes canonical + raw_seconds additive. D10/D11
otherwise stand; D11 auto-start remains provisional pending Leah's first
session.
 
### R5 · Ruling on O5 — Destinies for unmapped surfaces — 2026-06-11
 
Four destinies exist: document section / ledger / margin / quiet exile
(⌘K-reachable, no nav presence). Assignments:
- **Reviews** → Care section + margin item on arrival; aggregate column in People.
- **Nurture** → dissolves: due follow-ups rise on the Desk as need lines; the
  cadence lives in Care; the queue becomes a People filter.
- **Rooms directory** → dissolves into documents (project_rooms / proposal scope).
- **Portfolio** → quiet exile; sources Install/Care photos; ⌘K-reachable.
- **Resources** → quiet exile behind the help affordance.
- **Team** → settings region; D6 presence covers in-document visibility.
- **Inbox** → retire after Slice-6 verification that margins + Desk cover all
  unique functions.
- **Aesthete** folds, not shelves: teaching becomes a mode of the Library
  ledger (classification lives with products); Engine stats and teaching
  royalties move into Accounts — the 25% Pledge rendered as a line in the
  studio's own account book.
- **Insights** distributes as each ledger's front-matter summary page
  (Accounts: revenue/AR · People: pipeline conversion · Orders: procurement
  throughput · Hours: utilization). No dashboard book.
- **Vendors** → Orders ledger directory pane; People stays clients-only.

## Implementation decisions — Slice 1 (2026-06-11)

### I4 · Desk reads engagements from a `document_state` view — 2026-06-11

Migration 00188 creates a SECURITY INVOKER view unioning the R1 shapes
(project / live proposal chain / open lead / pre-proposal relationship) with
derived `active_section` (§4) and need-input counts (§7), so Desk, the Slice 2
spine, and ⌘K share one source (§11.6). Slice 1 renders pre-signing
engagements as Desk folders only — no `/doc` route exists yet; the route
scheme for proposal-chain/lead documents (spec §3 permits a canonicalizing
resolver) will be decided and logged in Slice 2.

### I5 · DocSheet built without design-system overlay primitives — 2026-06-11

The first `Doc*` wrapper implements its own minimal dialog semantics (Esc,
backdrop dismiss, focus in/restore) rather than wrapping a shadowed
design-system primitive. The R3 `no-restricted-imports` ban is in place for
Document dirs; when a future wrapper genuinely needs a primitive, that file
gets an explicit exemption in `eslint.config.mjs` (documented inline there).

### I6 · Desk heuristics v1 — 2026-06-11

Hesitating proposal = sent >3 days unopened, or opened >5 days unsigned.
Lead urgency = response deadline inside 48h (or passed). Motion chips capped
at 6. All thresholds are constants in `desk-derivation.ts` — tune with Leah
during phase-in step 2.

### I7 · Signed-awaiting-activation proposals surface on the Desk — 2026-06-11

An `accepted` proposal with no project row (signed, `activate_proposal_as_project`
not yet run) was invisible in the original union — the Desk would silently
omit the signing moment. Now surfaces as a needs-your-hand folder: need line
"Signed — open the project", SIGNED stamp (sage), ranked directly under
overdue decisions. §4 doesn't enumerate this sub-state; flagged for design
review in the Slice 1 PR since the need line is designer-visible.

### D12 · Full-bleed document — 2026-06-11

A document in hand fills the entire viewport. No charcoal surround, no page
border or radius, no stacked edge — those are Desk-state devices, for objects
ON the desk; in hand, the paper IS the screen (D1 expressed spatially). The
Studio Drawer is the only persistent layer above the paper — the desk edge
still showing beneath the work. Ledger sheets, the log strip, Doc* popovers,
and ⌘K are the only other overlays; nothing else coexists with an open
document. The spine and margin become sticky full-height rails (Put down,
timer, presence, and margin items always reachable); main content scrolls
between them, padded clear of the drawer. Pick up = raise-to-fill scale
(~270ms; reduced-motion: crossfade); put down recedes to the Desk. The Desk
itself is unchanged. Prototype v0.4 is the canonical reference; spec §3/§10
amended at next revision. Mobile interim: spine = sticky horizontal paper
strip at top, margin flows after main — the dedicated D3 pattern still gates
the flip.

---

## Implementation decisions — Slice 2 (2026-06-11)

### I8 · Document route: one `/doc/[id]` + canonicalizing resolver — 2026-06-11

All three engagement shapes share a single route. The id accepts ANY of the
engagement's keys — engagement_id (canonical: project id / proposal-chain
root / lead id / relationship id), or the live proposal id — resolved by one
`document_state` lookup (`.or()` across the key columns); the URL is not
rewritten. Per spec §3's "canonicalizing resolver is acceptable." Limit: an
ACTIVATED proposal's id no longer resolves (shape B excludes proposals with
a project row) — those engagements are addressed by project id, which is how
the Desk and ⌘K link them anyway.

### I9 · DAMAGED stamp attribution is PO-level — 2026-06-11

`receiving_inspections` / `damage_claims` hang off `purchase_orders` (00150)
with no FF&E-item FK, so every line on a PO with an open claim (drafted /
vendor_notified) stamps DAMAGED until the claim resolves. Per-item
attribution would need additive schema; deferred until the Slice 4 unfold
shows claim detail. Designer-visible over-attribution on multi-item POs —
flagged for design review.

### I10 · Slice 2 presentation seams — 2026-06-11

Sequencing artifacts a designer will notice, all per the §13 build order,
flagged for review in the slice PR: the margin rail ships present but empty
(fills in Slice 3); the spine ships without the timer box (Slice 5); only
the Proposal settled bar unfolds (Brief/Discovery/Direction bars are inert
until their unfolds are designed); Discovery and Care active bodies are one
quiet line each (Care grows its Guide/reviews/cadence at R5 in Slice 6).
Spine sub-labels only claim dates the data actually carries.

## Rulings — design session, 2026-06-11 (Slice 2 review)

### R6 · Ruling on I8 — Resolver redirects activated proposal ids — 2026-06-11

I8 blessed with one amendment: the stated limit (an activated proposal's id no
longer resolves) is a dead link across the signing moment — the document grew,
the URL must agree. The resolver catches ids of proposals that have a project
row and redirects to `/doc/[projectId]` (one extra lookup on the miss path;
`router.replace`, no history pollution). Bookmarked or shared pre-signing
links survive activation. No URL rewriting otherwise; I8 stands as logged.

### R7 · Ruling on I9 — DAMAGED stamp deferred to per-item attribution — 2026-06-11

The over-attributing stamp does not ship. Stamps are the document's truth
device (R2: pure renderings of real state); PO-level claim data stamping every
line on a multi-item PO lies at the item grain and teaches the designer to
discount stamps. Until per-item attribution exists, claims surface where they
are true: the line unfold's PO detail, the Orders ledger, and a Desk need line
("PO-0214 has an open damage claim"). In Slice 4, add the additive
`ffe_item_id` FK to damage_claims/receiving_inspections and ship DAMAGED as a
truthful per-item stamp. Spec §6 DAMAGED row amended accordingly at next
revision.

### R8 · Ruling on I10 — Slice 2 seams — 2026-06-11

Margin rail ships present with one quiet placeholder line in muted italic
("The margin — decisions, messages, and money gather here") — honest
scaffolding that keeps the D12 full-bleed geometry stable when Slice 3 fills
it. Inert settled bars (Brief/Discovery/Direction pre-unfold) must NOT render
the "unfold ↓" hint — affordances that do nothing teach the document to lie;
hint copy appears only when a bar's unfold ships. Spine sub-labels claiming
only real dates: blessed as logged. Timer box absent until Slice 5: blessed.

### R9 · Pilot checkpoint — Leah's first structured session — 2026-06-11

Informal peeks anytime; the first structured first-Tuesday session happens
after Slice 3, when the margin loop (decision → stamp + margin + Desk in one
act) works against Middlewest's real data. Rationale: first impressions don't
repeat, and the margin is the concept's heart — a shell with a placeholder
margin risks anchoring on "pretty but hollow." The D11 auto-start gut-check
and idle-threshold calibration still occur at Slice 5.

---

## Implementation decisions — Slice 2 amendments (2026-06-11)

### I11 · R6–R8 implementation notes — 2026-06-11

R6: implemented as one extra `proposals.project_id` lookup on the resolver's
miss path; `router.replace`, loading state holds until the redirect lands.
R7: migration 00189 appends `open_claim_count` / `open_claim_po`
(vendor_po_number, falling back to sidemark) to `document_state`; the line
stamp and its PO→inspections→claims select are removed. The Desk need line
reads "AP-012 has an open damage claim" (pluralizes without a PO identifier)
and ranks below overdue decisions and the signing moment, above everything
else. Its stamp label is **CLAIM OPEN** — not DAMAGED, which R7 reserves for
the truthful per-item stamp in Slice 4 — designer-visible word choice,
flagged for review. R8: placeholder line rendered verbatim in muted italic;
inert settled bars were already affordance-free (hint shows only the settled
date; "unfold ↓" appears solely on bars whose unfold exists).

---

## Implementation decisions — Slice 3 (2026-06-11)

### I12 · Pulse v1 mechanics — 2026-06-11

The Friday draft job is pure SQL (pg_cron, Fridays 13:00 UTC): one draft
`weekly_pulses` row per active project per ISO week — no edge function, no
email. The client mirror is the project comms thread: `send_weekly_pulse`
(00192) flips the pulse and posts the message in ONE transaction, so the
client sees it in their portal Messages and the existing comms notification
machinery fires. An email leg (Resend) can ride later without schema change
— **flagged for design**: is in-portal + comms-notification enough for v1?
The default draft body composes from the week's REAL movement (FF&E stamp
changes this week + decisions settled/pending), editable before send.

### I13 · Margin mechanics — 2026-06-11

The `margin_items` view (00191) is an INDEX (kind, anchor, state, thin
payload); expanding an item fetches content through the existing domain
hooks. Message `unread` derives from the caller's `last_read_at`; opening
the item marks the thread read. Time rows are read-only daily summaries
until Slice 5. Decision resolution from the margin uses the shipped
override-with-consent path (`useApplyDecisionOverride` → `apply_decision`)
— the designer records the client's pick with method + evidence, audit row
included; UI wording "Record the pick" — **flagged for design review**.
Decision due-date extension is a plain `due_date` patch; the margin item
narrates it (R2: the stamp shows only the current date). Invoice send =
`issue_invoice` RPC + the existing `invoice-send` edge function.

### R13 · Pulse email leg — v1 as built; email gates the flip — 2026-06-12
Slice 3's Pulse ships as logged (portal message + existing comms
notification): for the pilot, Leah's clients get a Friday inbox touch via the
comms-notification email, which is acceptable scaffolding. The full-body
Friday email (Resend leg, using the already-designed Pulse template from the
journey email set) is added to the DEFAULT-FLIP GATES — the Pulse's product
truth is reassurance arriving where the client lives, and that is the inbox.
No schema change required per I12. Flip gates now: D3/D13 mobile validation ·
Pulse email leg · idle annotation (D10) · R5 destinies staged.

### R14 · The Note — sixth margin kind — 2026-06-12
Ratifying Leah's Session 01 finding: designer-authored marginalia, the most
literal margin item of all. Spec: kind `note`, Mocha-adjacent accent (distinct
from time; suggest Aged Oak), authored by any studio member, anchored like all
margin items (line / section / letterhead; default letterhead). CAPTURE MUST
BE ≤5 SECONDS — one tap from the margin rail header ("+ Note") on desktop and
from the spine sheet's margin section on mobile; from a line unfold, the note
pre-anchors to that line. Optional due date; a dued note joins needs-action
ordering (R12), otherwise notes sit in anchor order. ESCALATION is what makes
it structural: a note converts in place to (a) a client decision via the
shipped decisions machinery, or (b) a Scope Change Authorization when the
call was a change request — if no SCA artifact exists in the codebase yet,
Claude Code stubs the action and flags it (audit-first; do not invent the
artifact). Notes are studio-visible (D6), never client-visible — the margin's
private layer. Sequencing: rides Slice 4 as an add-on while the margin
machinery is fresh; storage is additive (margin_notes or equivalent — naming
to repo conventions).

### R15 · Strata Mark fill-state + the breath — 2026-06-12
Ratifying Leah's Question 9, moderated. The mark becomes a progress device:
its three lines render as fill-state mapped to the engagement's three
movements — line 1 fills through SHAPING (Brief→Direction), line 2 at
COMMITMENT (proposal signed), line 3 through DELIVERY (Install→Care).
Unfilled lines render at the ghost opacity already in the recipe. Surfaces:
folder tabs' mark, the letterhead mark, ⌘K result rows — anywhere the mark
stands for a document. Spine section markers keep their per-section state
colors (settled/active/ghost) — they answer "which section," the fill-state
answers "how far." MOTION: exactly one — a slow breath (~3s ease, subtle
opacity swell) on the ACTIVE spine marker only, where "alive" is literally
true; `prefers-reduced-motion` disables it; nothing on the Desk ever moves.
"Pulsing" beyond this is declined — ambient motion is what the no-badge
discipline exists to prevent. Sequencing: fill-state is static rendering and
ships with Slice 4 (Leah gets her brand moment next session); the breath
joins the Slice 6 motion pass.
