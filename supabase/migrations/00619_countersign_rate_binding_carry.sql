-- 00619 — HT-4: countersign carries the role binding onto the signed snapshot
--
-- 00618 gave the rate card an enum and taught both pricing bodies to ask it.
-- This file is the one line between them: the countersign materialization that
-- freezes proposal_service_rates into project_billing_authority_rates must copy
-- roster_role across, or every card the resolver actually reads is a label
-- again the moment the agreement is executed — which is the string match HT-4
-- deletes, arriving one transaction later.
--
-- Lineage (_countersign_design_services_agreement_impl):
--   00412 → 00414 → 00475 → 00511 → 00566 → 00575 → 00577 → 00578:6011 → 00619.
-- The body below is 00578:6011-6641 VERBATIM (extracted by line range, not
-- retyped), with ONE column added to ONE INSERT and nothing else touched: the
-- four kind deltas 00578's PART 9 grafted, the lock order, the addendum
-- promotion loop, the retainer invoice leg, the execution snapshot and every
-- raise are byte-identical to the body 00578 installs.
--
-- THIS IS THE ONLY PATH THAT MATERIALIZES AUTHORITY RATES. Verified by grep
-- over every migration: the eight `INSERT INTO public.project_billing_authority_rates`
-- sites (00412:1094, 00414:869, 00475:848, 00511:4552, 00566:799, 00575:1797,
-- 00577:2469, 00578:6562) are all redefinitions of this one lineage — the first
-- two under its pre-extraction name `countersign_design_services_agreement`. So
-- one delta here covers every way a rate card becomes an authority rate, and
-- there is no second door to keep in step.
--
-- Rows materialized BEFORE this migration keep roster_role NULL, and 00618's
-- legacy normalized-label leg — kept whole in both pricing bodies — prices them
-- exactly as it did yesterday. Nothing signed is rewritten (P-4, and
-- guard_billing_authority_rates_immutable would refuse it anyway).
