-- 00202 — The Work: section tasks + approval gates (R23, Dissolve Track 1.1)
--
-- Audit-first findings (DECISIONS I25, forthcoming):
--   · The package proposed a new `section_tasks` table; the codebase already
--     carries `project_tasks` (00169: title/status/due_date/completed_at/
--     sort_order/phase_key). Codebase wins — extend additively, never fork.
--   · Approval gates ride `client_decisions` exactly as ruled: additive
--     `decision_kind` ('choice' default · 'approval') + `section_key`.
--     The winning option carries an explicit `approves` flag — approval is
--     a fact on the option, never a string match on its name.
--   · Settlement mechanics (phase advance + milestone draft) land in 00204,
--     lexically after the milestone trigger columns they reference.
--
-- Additive only (D7). Old zones untouched.

-- ── 1. The work block: extend project_tasks ─────────────────────────────────

alter table project_tasks
  add column if not exists section_key text
    check (section_key in ('brief','discovery','direction','proposal','project','install','care')),
  add column if not exists estimate_minutes integer
    check (estimate_minutes > 0),
  add column if not exists created_by uuid references profiles(id) on delete set null;

comment on column project_tasks.section_key is
  'The Document section this task belongs to (R23 "The work"). NULL = legacy task with phase_key attribution only.';
comment on column project_tasks.estimate_minutes is
  'Optional hour estimate (stored in minutes). Sums into the work-head meta ("9h of 14h est.") and the Hours ledger readout (R23).';

create index if not exists idx_project_tasks_section
  on project_tasks(project_id, section_key)
  where section_key is not null;

-- Dued tasks rise on the Desk (R23/R22 action test) — index the need-line scan.
create index if not exists idx_project_tasks_due_open
  on project_tasks(project_id, due_date)
  where status = 'todo' and due_date is not null;

-- ── 2. Gates are decisions: extend client_decisions ─────────────────────────

alter table client_decisions
  add column if not exists decision_kind text not null default 'choice'
    check (decision_kind in ('choice','approval')),
  add column if not exists section_key text
    check (section_key in ('brief','discovery','direction','proposal','project','install','care'));

comment on column client_decisions.decision_kind is
  'R23: ''approval'' = a section gate (client approval settles the section). ''choice'' = the shipped option-pick decision. Same machinery, same mirror, same Desk.';
comment on column client_decisions.section_key is
  'The Document section an approval gate is anchored to (R23). NULL for choice decisions (their anchor derives from blocked lines / letterhead).';

create index if not exists idx_client_decisions_gates
  on client_decisions(project_id, section_key)
  where decision_kind = 'approval';

alter table client_decision_options
  add column if not exists approves boolean not null default false;

comment on column client_decision_options.approves is
  'R23 gates: true on the option whose selection means "approved" (settles the section). False = request-changes / decline.';

-- ── 3. document_state v6: dued-task need-line inputs ────────────────────────
-- Recreates the 00200 view verbatim + three appended columns per shape:
--   due_task_count · earliest_task_due · due_task_title
-- (Tasks are project-scoped in v1 — project_tasks FK; other shapes carry 0.)
