-- 00192 — document_state v3 (Friday-pulse Desk input, D5) + send_weekly_pulse
--
-- 1. Appends to document_state (after 00189's claim columns):
--      unsent_pulse_count — current-week draft pulses for the project
--      pulse_week_of      — that draft's week (Desk derivation gates the
--                           need line to Friday-or-later, D5)
--    Everything before the appended columns is byte-identical to 00189.
--
-- 2. send_weekly_pulse(p_pulse_id, p_body, p_subject) — the one-act send
--    (§5 invariant): pulse → sent, the client mirror posted into the
--    project's comms thread (existing bump/notification triggers fire),
--    margin + Desk update via the same row, all in ONE transaction.
--    SECURITY INVOKER: pulse RLS (designer-owned) + thread participation
--    scope every step to the caller.
