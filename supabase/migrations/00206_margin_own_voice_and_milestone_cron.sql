-- 00206 — R33 F1/F6 + R34 (Track 1 review fixes, 2026-06-12)
--
-- 1. margin_items v5 — recreates the 00202 view verbatim; only the MESSAGE
--    branch changes:
--      F1 · own_voice: a thread whose LATEST message is studio-authored
--          (sender is not a client/vendor participant; system messages count
--          as the studio's) never derives 'unread' — the margin asks for her
--          hand; her own voice never qualifies. The payload carries
--          own_voice so the rail sinks the item into the Settled fold.
--      F6 · sender names: sender_name is the profile's display name; when a
--          STUDIO-authored sender has no name, the guard falls back to the
--          engagement's studio name — never a role noun. A nameless
--          client/vendor sender stays null (plain "Message" beats a
--          misattribution — F2's trust line).
--
-- 2. R34 · on_date milestones WIRE to draft_invoice_from_milestone: a date
--    the designer deliberately configured arriving IS the drafting moment.
--    Drafts only — review-then-send unchanged; the invoice_id latch in
--    draft_invoice_from_milestone (00204) guards repeats. on_signing stays
--    a designer act (config stored, drafting manual).
