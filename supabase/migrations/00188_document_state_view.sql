-- 00188 — document_state view
--
-- The Document workstream, Slice 1 (spec v1.1 §4 / §7 / §11.6, ruling R1).
-- One row per ENGAGEMENT, unioning the three addressable shapes:
--   A. 'project'      — signed work (one row per projects row)
--   B. 'proposal'     — pre-signing live proposal chain (one row per chain)
--   C. 'lead'         — open lead, designer has not accepted (Brief active)
--   D. 'relationship' — accepted relationship, no proposal yet (Discovery)
-- (C and D are the spec's single "lead/designer_client" shape, split because
--  Brief vs Discovery derive from different tables.)
--
-- active_section implements the §4 stage→section mapping so Desk, document
-- spine (Slice 2), and ⌘K share one source. Need-input counts (§7) ride along
-- so the Desk query is one SELECT. Purely additive (D7): no table changes.
--
-- SECURITY INVOKER: every branch reads base tables under the caller's RLS,
-- so rows are scoped exactly as the underlying policies dictate (D6:
-- studio-visible where the base tables say so).
